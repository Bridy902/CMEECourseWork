There are some introduction about some code:
> align_seqs_fasta.py: 
This script aligns two DNA sequences from FASTA files and calculates the best alignment score. It is designed for simple pairwise alignment using a basic scoring mechanism.

> cfexercise1.py:
This script contains a collection of Python functions that perform various mathematical operations, including calculating square roots, finding the largest number, sorting numbers, and calculating factorials. Each function is designed to demonstrate basic programming concepts and functionality in Python.

> okas_debugme.py:
This script reads a CSV file containing plant data and filters for oak species, specifically those belonging to the genus *Quercus*. It outputs the filtered data into a new CSV file.

> Ic1.py:
This script processes a collection of bird species data, extracting their Latin names, common names, and mean body masses. It demonstrates both list comprehensions and conventional loops for data extraction.

> Ic2.py:
This script processes monthly rainfall data, extracting information about months with high and low rainfall. It demonstrates both list comprehensions and conventional loops for data extraction.

> tuple.py:
This script prints details about various bird species, including their Latin names, common names, and mean body masses.

> dictionary.py:
This script organizes a list of taxa into a dictionary based on their taxonomic order. It demonstrates both conventional loops and dictionary comprehensions for populating the data structure.
