# Feedback on Project Structure and Code

## Project Structure

### Repository Organization
The repository is logically organized, with the necessary directories like `Code`, `Data`, `Results`, and `Sandbox`. This structure ensures a clean workflow. However, the `.gitignore` file is missing. Adding a `.gitignore` file would prevent unnecessary files like results or temporary files from being tracked, ensuring the repository remains clean.

### README Files
The main `README.md` provides an overview of the repository but could be enhanced by including more detailed information, such as how to run the scripts, any dependencies required, and specific instructions for each file. Additionally, the Week1 directory lacks a README file, which should be added to explain the purpose of the directory and its contents in more detail.

## Workflow
The workflow is clear, with code, data, and results neatly separated. However, the results directory contains several files that ideally should not be stored in version control. Instead, these should be generated dynamically when running the scripts. Removing these files and adding a `.gitignore` for results would help maintain a clean repository.

## Code Syntax & Structure

### Shell Scripts
1. **TabToCSV.sh:**
   - This script works as expected, converting a tab-delimited file to CSV. The input validation is handled well, and it uses good practices such as providing usage information when the arguments are incorrect. No major issues were found.

2. **UniPrac1.txt:**
   - This script efficiently handles the various operations on `.fasta` files, such as counting lines, removing the first line, and computing the AT/GC ratio. Adding more comments for each step would improve readability for users unfamiliar with Unix commands. The AT/GC ratio calculation is well-constructed using `bc` for precision.

3. **CsvToSpace.sh:**
   - This script converts CSV files to space-separated values and correctly handles input validation. It also checks the file extension, which is good practice. No issues were encountered during testing.

4. **ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh:**
   - This script concatenates two input files into a third output file. The input validation and error handling are well-implemented, but it could benefit from a check to prevent overwriting the output file without warning.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Error Handling:** Across the scripts, error handling is good, but checks for overwriting output files would improve robustness. Consider adding a prompt or check to avoid accidental overwriting.
- **README Enhancements:** Expanding the README files to include instructions on running the scripts, dependencies, and the overall project structure would be helpful for users or collaborators unfamiliar with the project.
- **Spelling & Formatting:** Minor improvements like correcting spelling (e.g., in comments) and enhancing formatting in the scripts could make the code easier to follow.
- **File Overwriting Prevention:** In `ConcatenateTwoFiles.sh`, consider adding checks to prevent overwriting existing files.

## Overall Feedback
The project is well-structured, and the scripts are functional and demonstrate good practices such as input validation and error handling. With some small improvements in error handling, README documentation, and file management, the project will be more robust and user-friendly. Overall, the work shows a solid understanding of shell scripting and workflow management.
